### Project Overview

The Memanoma Detector is a web application designed to analyze skin images for the presence of potential skin diseases, particularly focusing on melanoma detection. Users can upload an image, and the application will process it to determine if there are any signs of skin cancer. The result will be displayed along with a confidence percentage.
